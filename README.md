# CAPSAssignment

This is my multi-threaded C++ server application, made for my Concurrent and Parallel Systems assignment. I received a mark of 81 (First), and you can find supporting documentation in the 'Assignment Docs' folder, along with more instructions on how to run this project and its corresponding client.
